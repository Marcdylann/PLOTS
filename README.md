## Visualizations

1. **Horizontal Stacked Bar Chart**
2. **Sankey Diagram**
3. **Network Graph**

## Description

### Horizontal Stacked Bar Chart
The horizontal stacked bar chart is designed to display the distribution of categories within a dataset. It provides a clear visual representation of the proportional contributions of different categories to the total.

### Sankey Diagram
The Sankey diagram is used to illustrate the flow of data between different stages or categories. It effectively visualizes the magnitude of transfers or transformations within the dataset.

### Network Graph
The network graph represents relationships and connections between various entities in the dataset. It provides insights into the structure and dynamics of the network being analyzed.

## Usage

To view and interact with the visualizations, follow the instructions provided in the corresponding directories for each plot. Ensure that all required dependencies and libraries are installed.
